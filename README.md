# Moderation Station
## Description
This is a simple moderation web page that allows you to moderate the chat on YouTube and Twitch, all in one page. 

That's it. That's as simple as it gets.

The only thing that complicated this project was the fact that YouTube was a pain in the ass to work with. But I managed to get it working, using some funky ways. (Hence the php files)
